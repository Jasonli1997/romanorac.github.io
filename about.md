Having many lines of unstructured code on my laptop is no use to anyone.
So, I decided to give it a structure and share it with you!
I learned a lot from it and hopefully, you'll learn something too.

If you are interested in Machine Learning or anything related to
data analytics you'll find interesting reads on this blog.

I am Roman Orac and I am a data scientist for a few years now.
Currently, I am helping 1tap by Receipt Bank to build "smarter" products using Machine Learning.
I am interested in Deep Learning, data visualizations and I love Vim.
When I am not coding I like to go the seaside, skiing in the winter...
away from computers ðŸ˜Š
