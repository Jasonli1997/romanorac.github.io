Having many lines of unstructured code on my laptop is no use to anyone.
So, I decided to give it a structure and share it with you!

I learned a lot from it and hopefully, you'll learn something too. If you are interested in Machine Learning or anything related to
data analytics you'll find interesting reads on this blog.

I am Roman Orac and I am a data scientist for a few years now.
I am interested in Deep Learning, data visualizations and I love Vim.
